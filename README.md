# SADITA - A high resolution drought atlas for Chile and the Andes region

**What is the drought metric used:** The metric used to quantify soil moisture and drought variability is the self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index or [scPDSI](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/drought/). The index was computed for the Chilean domain using gridded precipitation from the [CR2MET dataset](http://www.cr2.cl/datos-productos-grillados/) at 5x5 km of resolution between La Serena and Chilo√©. For the Andean region of Chile and Argentina, the index was computed at 50x50km using gridded precipitation from the Climatic Research Unit [CRUTS 4.05 dataset](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/drought/)

**How the Atlas was done:** Annual maps of the summer scPDSI were reconstructed point-by-point (grid-by-grid) from a network tree-ring width chronologies of thousands of Andean trees.
